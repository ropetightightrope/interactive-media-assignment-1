    <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?

        How satisfying simply scrolling is, the smoothness of the transitions between sections.

<li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
    Scrolling through the different sections, clicking to change the color of the text, the text trails and how they reset after a certain number of loops, the auto playing video, click to add music, hovering over certain sections animates the text blob. 
    </li>
<li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?

    Scrolling to test the smoothness of the transitions, to see how the different elements move at different rates and times. I liked how the dolly or drone shot at the front of the music hall has cars driving and that changes the speed of how the scrolling felt.

<li> What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?

    The most common action by far was simply scrolling at different speeds. Wondering if they chopped a video or if they made a ramp for the dolly and took individual photos. Wondering if the cars being animated separately as they seem to move in a somewhat unnatural way.

<li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?


    Like the music hall itself it is very bombastic and huge feeling.while being inviting and lighthearted. The
